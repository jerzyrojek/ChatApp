# ChatApp

A simple room based chat application where every user can create a channel and send messages.

Project available at https://jerzyrojek.github.io/ChatApp/

## Description

This application was for me to experiment with React router, context and hooks such as useParams or useRef. 
This is also the first project where I tried using Material UI components and Firebase for authentication and storing data.
It could probably use a layout overhaul and possibly introduction of web sockets.

## Tech stack

- React - Router/Context

- Firebase Auth/Firestore
